# Creators-Handbook
I will try to use this repository to collate as much useful information as possible for the purposes to content creation. The focus here will be the development of plugins but also include suggestions on how to emulate the quality of vanilla Endless Sky.

The bulk of information will be held in the [Wiki](https://github.com/DarcyManoel/Endless-Sky-Creators-Handbook/wiki).
